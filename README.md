SKLS Galaxy Mall — Website Demo

A website I built for a mall near me that had no online presence.

SKLS Galaxy Mall in Red Hills, Chennai is a pretty popular spot locally — but they had no website at all.
I thought it was a waste, so I designed and built one myself and sent it to their management as a pitch.

**What's in it**
- Hero landing section with mall info
- Store categories by floor
- PVR Cinema showtimes section
- Offers and deals page
- Contact form with real address and timings
- Fully responsive — works on mobile too

**Built with** HTML · CSS · JavaScript

**Why I made this**
Wanted to work on something real instead of a todo app.
This felt useful — and it gave me something to actually send to someone.
