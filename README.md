SKLS Galaxy Mall — Website Demo
A website I built for a mall near me that had no online presence.
SKLS Galaxy Mall in Red Hills, Chennai is a pretty popular spot locally — but they had no website at all. I thought it was a waste, so I designed and built one myself and sent it to their management as a pitch.
What's in it

Hero landing section with mall info
Store categories by floor
PVR Cinema showtimes section
Offers and deals page
Contact form with real address and timings
Fully responsive — works on mobile too

Built with
HTML · CSS · JavaScript
Why I made this
Wanted to work on something real instead of a todo app. This felt useful — and it gave me something to actually send to someone.
